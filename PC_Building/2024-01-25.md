There are two P-state selection algorithms provided by intel_pstate in the active mode: powersave and performance. 
The way they both operate depends on whether or not the hardware-managed P-states (HWP) feature has been enabled 
in the processor and possibly on the processor model.

Which of the P-state selection algorithms is used by default depends on the CONFIG_CPU_FREQ_DEFAULT_GOV_PERFORMANCE 
kernel configuration option. Namely, if that option is set, the performance algorithm will be used by default, 
and the other one will be used by default if it is not set.


check kernel config 
cat /usr/src/linux-headers-"$(uname -r)"/.config  | grep GOV
But the boot one is here:
cat /boot/config-"$(uname -r)" | grep GOV


grep -i pstate /boot/config-$(uname -r)
